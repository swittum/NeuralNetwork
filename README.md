# Neural Network from Scratch
This project is the implementation of a Neural Network with one input, one hidden and one output layer (carrying 10 nodes, respectively) to classify the handwritten MNIST data set. 

## How to Use
To use this project, open a terminal in the current working directory and run the script "NeuralNetwork.py" with a suitable virtual environment. Have a look at the stdout in the terminal and wait until the program has completed. The determined weights and biases will be stored within .txt files in the ./data folder. It is then possible to test the network by running "python -i evaluate.py". In an interactive python session, you can then repeatedly validate the Network by running the command "main()".
